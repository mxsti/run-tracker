# RunTracker

Besides programming I like to run in my free time. I challenged myself to run as many kilometers and as often as possible. To track my progress (next to strava) and to check out some Angular on the side I created this simple webapp. 

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.0.4.


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Deployment

Running production version of the app is deployed with firebase on https://run-tracker-e15fb.web.app/ with my current real running data.

If you want to run the app you need an own firebase app with Firebase Storing enabled. Needed values have to be stored in the environment.ts in the environments folder like:

projectId: """,  
appId: "",  
storageBucket: "",  
apiKey: "",  
authDomain: "",  
messagingSenderId: "",
